# StartuPublicity
Hundreds of thousands of new companies are founded each year, and they typically have to operate with very limited marketing budgets. One way that startups can get extra publicity is by posting articles about their companies on Medium, an online publishing platform that has a large startup community. However, the range of attention these articles can receive is huge. Is there any way a company can know in advance how popular their article will be? 

StartuPublicity is an app that predicts the number of claps Medium articles about startups will receive, and suggests specific ways to improve the article in order to increase its popularity. Popularity predictions are made using a machine-learning model that incorporates information about each article's topic and various writing-style features like the length and overall readability of the article. 

I developed this app as part of the Insight Data Science Fellows Program in New York City during Winter 2019.
